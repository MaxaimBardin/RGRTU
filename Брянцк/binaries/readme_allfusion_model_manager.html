<h2><a name="welcome">1.0  Welcome</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to AllFusion Model Manager (AllFusion MM) r7.2.5
Service Pack 1, a member of the AllFusion Modeling Suite.
This file contains operating system support, system
requirements, installation considerations, known issues,
documentation notes, and information about contacting CA
Technical Support.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="operating_system_support">2.0  Operating System Support</a></h2>
<p>AllFusion MM requires that you have one of the following
operating systems installed:
<ul>
<p><li>Microsoft Windows 2003 Server
<p><li>Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2
<p><li>Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3
</ul>
<p>The following requirements must be met or exceeded for
AllFusion MM to install and run correctly:
<ul>
<p><li>Intel Pentium III or equivalent supported by the Host DBMS
<p><li>200 MB Hard Disk Space
<p><li>512 MB RAM
<p><li>Any operating system supported by the Host DBMS
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="system_requirements">3.0  System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The following hardware and software requirements must be
met or exceeded for AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 to
install and run correctly:
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="allfusion_mm_administrator_server_requirements">3.1  AllFusion MM Administrator Server Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Verify that the machine where the software and license key
(the administrator's workstation or file server for
administrative files) are installed meets the minimum
requirements summarized below. The disk space required for
the administrative files used to create and manage the
database is separate from the disk space required to
accommodate models on the server where the database is
located. Greater CPU speed, and more RAM and disk space
result in better performance.  
<p><b>Note:</b> While not recommended, the software and license key
can be installed on the same machine as the database server.
<ul>
<p><li>Intel Pentium III or equivalent
<p><li>100 MB Disk Space
<p><li>1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended for large models)
<p><li>Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003 Server Operating System
<p><b>Note:</b> Greater CPU speed, and more RAM and disk space result
in better performance. The memory requirement of 512 MB is
for the minimum size models of only a few entities. Larger
size models may need greater memory. Experience has shown
that 1 GB RAM and 500 MB disk space seems to be the most
effective for our clients.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="dbms_requirements">3.2  DBMS Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Before you install AllFusion MM, you must use a DBMS
supported by AllFusion MM as your host server. AllFusion MM
r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 supports the following host DBMS:
<ul>
<p><li>Oracle 8.1.7, 9i and 10g
<p><li>SQL Server (7.0, 2000/2005)
<p><li>Sybase 12.x
</ul>
<p>The AllFusion MM mart administrator should be the database
owner (dbo) for Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase, or the
schema owner for Oracle. Before the administrator can
install the AllFusion MM mart on the server, they must
verify that the DBMS environment is prepared for AllFusion
MM installation, and that the server system requirements
meet at least the minimum specifications. Additionally, the
administrator of the DBMS, must set up user permissions for
the AllFusion MM mart.
<p><b>Note:</b> The DBA role is necessary only during the
installation or upgrade. You can strip the installer of the
DBA role after the installation or upgrade is complete.
<p>For information preparing the DBMS environment, see the
AllFusion Model Manager Implementation Guide.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="client_workstation_requirements">3.3  Client Workstation Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Each client workstation must have access to the DBMS on
which AllFusion MM is installed. It is recommended that
client workstations have at least 512 MB of RAM. You must
also install an AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler (AllFusion
ERwin DM) and/or AllFusion Process Modeler (AllFusion PM)
client on each client workstation to use the data modeling
and multi-user features. AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
supports the following client products:
<ul>
<p><li>AllFusion<sup>®</sup> ERwin<sup>®</sup> Data Modeler r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
<p><li>AllFusion<sup>®</sup> Process Modeler r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
<p><li>AllFusion<sup>®</sup> Model Navigator r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
<p><li>AllFusion<sup>®</sup> Data Model Validator r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> The memory requirement of 512 MB is for the minimum
size models of only a few entities. Larger size models may
need greater memory. Experience has shown that 1 GB RAM
seems to be the most effective for our clients.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installation_considerations">4.0  Installation Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Review the following installation considerations before
installing the product. See the AllFusion Model Manager
Implementation guide for more information on the
installation process.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="silent_install">4.1  Silent Install</a></h3>
<p>AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 does not provide an
unattended or silent install.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="requirement_for_connecting_to_microsoft_sql_server_2005">4.2  Requirement for Connecting to Microsoft SQL Server 2005</a></h3>
<p>If you are trying to connect to an AllFusion Model Manager
database which resides on SQL Server 2005 from a machine
that does not have the SQL Server 2000 client installed,
you will not be able to connect to AllFusion Model Manager.
AllFusion Model Manager requires the use of DB-Library for
connecting to SQL Server databases. SQL Server 2005 no
longer distributes the DB-Library files, though DB-Library
is supported for connecting to SQL Server 2005.  
<p>In order to be able to connect to an AllFusion Model
Manager database which resides on SQL Server 2005, the file
NTWDBLIB.DLL needs to be installed to the
c:\windows\system32 folder on your workstation. If you have
a SQL Server 2000 installation CD, the SQL Server 2000
client can be installed from the CD by executing
sqlredis.exe located on in the \x86\Other folder. If you do
not have a SQL Server 2000 installation CD, you can find
the file in a directory named "support" on the root of the
AllFusion CD.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="microsoft_sql_server_2005_permissions">4.3  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Permissions</a></h3>
<p>For SQL Server 2000, you only need to have public assigned
in order to save to the mart. However, when the repository
is on an SQL Server 2005 instance, you need to have the
bulkadmin permission designated as well. The ability to do
bulk inserts (which was permitted by public, previously) is
no longer part of the public permission. You must
explicitly define this permission or when you attempt to
save a model to a new AllFusion Model Manager instance
created using an SQL Server 2005 database, an error "You do
not have permission to use the bulk load statement." is
returned.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="allfusion_mm_client_version_checking">4.4  AllFusion MM Client Version Checking</a></h3>
<p>When you connect a client (AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler and
AllFusion Process Modeler) to an AllFusion MM database, the
software checks to verify that the client version is
compatible with the current version of the AllFusion MM
database. There is a version dependency, however the
Service Pack version can vary.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="general_considerations">5.0  General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>This section contains general information you should know
before using AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conversion_information">5.1  Conversion Information</a></h3>
<p>AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 will be installed into
the same folders on your hard drive as any previous
AllFusion Model Manager r7.x product.  Since r7.2.5 Service
Pack 1 is an upgrade of r7.0, the name will remain
AllFusion Model Manager r7 on the Start menu, however the
group name has changed from Computer Associates to CA.
<p>The following upgrade paths are available for AllFusion MM:
<ul>
<p><li>From AllFusion MM 4.1.4 to AllFusion MM r7, r7.1, or r7.2.5
Service Pack 1
<p><li>From AllFusion MM r7 to AllFusion MM r7.1 or r7.2.5 Service
Pack 1
</ul>
<p>For users of AllFusion MM 4.1.4, see the Upgrading
AllFusion MM chapter of the AllFusion Model Manager
Administrator Guide for more information on converting your
AllFusion MM 4.1.4 database to an AllFusion MM r7.2.5
Service Pack 1 database. This guide is in .PDF format, and
can be opened from the AllFusion Model Manager program
group (Start, Programs, CA, AllFusion, Model Manager r7,
AllFusion MM Administrator Guide).
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are running a version earlier than 4.1.4, you
need to upgrade to 4.1.4 before you can upgrade to r7.2.5
Service Pack 1. You must open and save your models in
AllFusion MM Version 4.1.4 before you can upgrade to
AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack 1.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conversion_preparation_recommendations">5.2  Conversion Preparation Recommendations</a></h3>
<ol>
<p><li>Verify that all models to be converted were saved and
opened in your AllFusion MM 4.1.4 database.
<p><li>Close all open AllFusion MM 4.1.4 sessions.
<p><li>Delete any unnecessary models. This reduces the conversion
time and the amount of space used by the AllFusion MM 4.1.4
database during the conversion.
</ol>
<p>A complete AllFusion MM Pre-Conversion checklist is
available on <a href="http://www.ca.com/support" target="_blank">http://ca.com/support</a> in the Conversion
Information Center on the Product Home Page for AllFusion
Model Manager. Before attempting to convert your ModelMart,
be sure to read this document. If you need assistance
during the conversion process, you can open a support issue
from the support link.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conversion_of_allfusion_mm_4_1_4_custom_security_profiles">5.3  Conversion of AllFusion MM 4.1.4 Custom Security Profiles</a></h3>
<p>Enhancements to the AllFusion ERwin DM r7.2.5 Service Pack
1 meta-model may have an affect on custom security profiles
that you created in AllFusion MM 4.1.4. If you defined
custom security profiles or modified existing ones in the
previous release, review your permissions to ensure that
your security requirements are met in AllFusion MM r7.2.5
Service Pack 1.  
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="conversion_notes_for_oracle_and_microsoft_sql_server_sybase">5.4  Conversion Notes for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase</a></h3>
<p>Before you attempt an AllFusion MM 4.1.4 database
conversion, please note the following.
<p><b>For Oracle 9i or earlier AllFusion MM 4.1.4 databases:</b>
<ul>
<ol>
<p><li>Make sure you have at least as many rollback segments as
used by your AllFusion MM 4.1.4 database. We strongly
recommend that you follow the guidelines in the AllFusion
Model Manager Administrator Guide.
<p><li>Before you start a conversion, it is strongly recommended
that you shrink rollback segments. Below is a sample SQL
statement (for each segment):
<p>ALTER ROLLBACK SEGMENT &lt;RBS_NAME&gt; SHRINK;
</ol>
</ul>
<p>
It is safe to randomly shrink rollback segments while the
conversion is running, but you must be logged in as the DBA.
<p><b>For Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase AllFusion MM 4.1.4
databases:</b>
<p>
tempdb should be as big as the AllFusion MM DB size.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="understanding_complete_compare_differences_after_converting_your_models">5.5  Understanding Complete Compare Differences After Converting Your Models</a></h3>
<p>If you are working with ERwin 4.1.4, you can upgrade a
model by opening and saving it in r7.2.5 Service Pack 1.
You can also "round-trip" your r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 model
by saving it as a 4.1.4 model and opening it again in
r7.2.5 Service Pack 1. You can use Complete Compare to
compare the models as you work with them in version 4.1.4
and r7.2.5 Service Pack 1.
<p>The technical document "Understanding Complete Compare
Differences After Converting Your Models" helps you
understand differences you may encounter in Complete
Compare when working with 4.1.4 and r7.2.5 Service Pack 1
models. You can find the document on <a href="http://www.ca.com/support" target="_blank">http://ca.com/support</a>
in the Conversion Information Center on the Product Home
Page for AllFusion Model Manager.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="model_display_in_the_difference_reconciliation_dialog">5.6  Model Display in the Difference Reconciliation Dialog</a></h3>
<p>In a workgroup modeling environment, two users may check
out and make changes to the same model. The first user may
make changes to the model and save the changes to the mart.
When the second modeler makes changes and saves them to the
mart, the Difference Reconciliation dialog is displayed.
You use features in this dialog to view the differences on
the object level, or more detailed property level. You can
search the text of the comparison lists, and you can
generate a report of the differences. Note that in the
Difference Reconciliation Dialog the model in the left pane
is the current model that you are checking in to the mart.
The model in the right pane is the version of the model
already in the mart.  
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="features_added_to_improve_complete_compare_performance_with_allfusion_model_manager">5.7  Features Added to Improve Complete Compare Performance with AllFusion Model Manager</a></h3>
<p>New features have been added to maximize performance when
working with AllFusion Model Manager models and Complete
Compare. When two different users check out a model from
AllFusion Model Manager, change the model, and check it
back in to the mart, the differences display in the
Difference Reconciliation dialog (part of the Complete
Compare user interface).  
<p>A conflict exists when two users check the same model out
of the mart, and then change the same object or property.
When each user checks their models back in to the mart, a
"three-way merge" is necessary to reconcile the differences
made by each user, and the unchanged objects and properties
in the mart. The three-way merge of the models is sometimes
slow for large models because all objects participate in
the compare process.
<p>With r7.2.5 Service Pack 1, this compare functionality has
changed to reduce the scope of comparison to only objects
that have changed for both the local and mart version of
the models. The criteria for detecting changes include the
following:
<ul>
<p><li>Objects that have been created in either the local or the
mart copy.
<p><li>Objects that have been deleted or modified in at least one
of either the local or mart copy.
</ul>
<p>Two new options have been added to the Options dialog
available from the Tools menu. The Model Manager tab of the
Options dialog now includes the following check boxes:
<dl>
<p><dt><b>Bypass Difference Reconciliation Dialog if there are no
conflicts</b>
<dd>Select this check box to skip the Difference Reconciliation
dialog if no conflicts are detected between the version of
the model in the mart and the local version. If no
conflicts are detected, the local copy is updated from the
mart version before the model is saved.
<p><dt><b>Show All Objects in Difference Reconciliation Dialog</b>
<dd>Select this check box to turn off the options to optimize
the compare process. The Difference Reconciliation dialog
will display all objects including those that were not
modified in the checked out model and in the mart copy of
the model.
</dl>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="uninstalling_the_allfusion_mm_administrative_files">5.8  Uninstalling the AllFusion MM Administrative Files</a></h3>
<p>You can use the Windows uninstall utility to uninstall the
AllFusion MM administrative files. However, when you
uninstall AllFusion MM, the AllFusion MM database remains
intact. To remove the database from your computer, delete
the AllFusion MM database first using AllFusion MM Model
Manager, and then uninstall the AllFusion MM administrative
files.

<h3><a name="sql_1105_error">6.1  SQL 1105 Error</a></h3>
<p>When you are upgrading to AllFusion MM r7.2.5 Service Pack
1 on Microsoft SQL, during the mart conversion process, you
may get the message "Sql 1105" if you run out of free hard
disk space during the process.
<p>Stop the conversion process, and either free hard disk
space or add hard disk. You should delete the already
created r7.2.5 Service Pack 1 AllFusion MM tables and then
re-attempt the conversion.

the release number does not change. For example, a document
for r7 may still be valid for r7.1 or even r8.
Documentation bookshelves always reflect the current
product release number.  
<p>Occasionally, we must update documentation outside of a new
or updated release. To indicate a minor change to the
documentation that does not invalidate it for any releases
that it supports, we update the edition number on the cover
page. First editions do not have an edition number.
