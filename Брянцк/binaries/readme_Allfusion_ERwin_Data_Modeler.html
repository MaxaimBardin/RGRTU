<h2><a name="installation_considerations">5.0  Installation Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Review the following installation considerations before
installing the product.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="installing_the_visual_studio_team_edition_for_database_professionals_allfusion_erwin_dm_integration">5.1  Installing the Visual Studio Team Edition for Database Professionals - AllFusion ERwin DM Integration</a></h3>
<p>When you run setup for AllFusion ERwin DM r7.2.5 Service
Pack 1, the installation script checks for a copy of
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Database
Professionals. If it detects a copy, the integration
components are automatically installed unless you cancel
the selection to install the components. You can also
modify an existing installation of AllFusion ERwin DM
r7.2.5 Serivce Pack 1 to add the Visual Studio integration.
See the installation instructions in Chapter 1 of the
<i>Integration Guide</i>, provided in PDF format in the \Doc
folder where AllFusion ERwin DM is installed.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="installing_api_components">5.2  Installing API Components</a></h3>
<p>The AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler API and two related
components (ERwin SPY, and the ERwin Sample API Client) are
included in the installation when you choose the Complete
Setup Type during setup. If you choose the Custom Setup
Type during setup, you can choose to customize the install
location, and review the space needed to install each
feature.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="requirement_for_connecting_to_sql_server_2005">5.3  Requirement for Connecting to SQL Server 2005</a></h3>
<p>If you are trying to connect to an AllFusion Model Manager
database which resides on SQL Server 2005 from a machine
that does not have the SQL Server 2000 client installed,
you will not be able to connect to AllFusion Model Manager.
AllFusion Model Manager requires the use of DB-Library for
connecting to SQL Server databases. SQL Server 2005 no
longer distributes the DB-Library files, though DB-Library
is supported for connecting to SQL Server 2005.  
<p>In order to be able to connect to an AllFusion Model
Manager database which resides on SQL Server 2005, the file
NTWDBLIB.DLL needs to be installed to the
c:\windows\system32 folder on your workstation. If you have
a SQL Server 2000 installation CD, the SQL Server 2000
client can be installed from the CD by executing
sqlredis.exe located on in the \x86\Other folder. If you do
not have a SQL Server 2000 installation CD, you can find
the file in a directory named "support" on the root of the
AllFusion ERwin DM CD.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="general_considerations">6.0  General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>This section contains general information you should know
before using AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler r7.2.5 Service
Pack 1.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="template_files_for_customizing_model_explorer_display">6.1  Template Files for Customizing Model Explorer Display</a></h3>
<p>Two template files are provided with AllFusion ERwin Data
Modeler that let you customize the display of object names
in the Model Explorer. By using macros in the template
file, you can override the default display of selected
object names.  
<p>The file <b>ModelExplorer logical display names.tmpl</b> includes
display options for the logical model. The file
<b>ModelExplorer physical display names.tmpl</b> includes display
options for the physical model. The files are installed to
the default installation directory for the product
(C:\Program Files\CA\AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler r7). 
<p>Comments and a sample macro are provided in the file to
customize the display of the parent/child relationship
phrase in the Model Explorer. By default, the display is
formatted to include the elements &lt;parent name&gt;
&lt;relationship name&gt; &lt;child name&gt;. You can modify the macro
to exclude one of the elements, for example if you wanted
to exclude the parent name in the display.
<p><b>Note:</b> If you modified the template file with build r7.1,
note that the syntax in the files has changed. The
templates no longer use the delimiters "{#" and "#}" to
enclose text.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="multiple_constraints_on_columns">6.2  Multiple Constraints on Columns</a></h3>
<p>Support for multiple constraints on columns in SQL Server
2000 or SQL Server 2005 in an AllFusion ERwin DM model is
not currently available.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="message_when_reverse_engineering_an_oracle_9i_script">6.3  Message When Reverse Engineering an Oracle 9i Script</a></h3>
<p>You may encounter an error message when you reverse
engineer an Oracle 9i script that includes comments that
are not associated with an object. The reverse engineering
process does not create a table for such comments. This
matches the behavior in Oracle, in which properties without
an associated object are not generated in the physical
database.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="sybase_check_constraints">6.4  Sybase CHECK Constraints</a></h3>
<p>CHECK constraints are treated differently in Sybase version
12.5 and 12.6/12.7. If you forward engineer a model to a
Sybase 12.5 database, table/column CHECK constraints are
not enforced, so the UNENFORCED keyword is required.  If
you forward engineer a model to a Sybase 12.6 or Sybase
12.7 database, CHECK constraints are enforced, so the
UNENFORCED keyword is not required.
<p>AllFusion ERwin DM currently supports Sybase 12.5 syntax.
For later releases, you must edit the DDL for CHECK
constraints to successfully execute on the database.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="synchronization_limitation_with_visual_studio_and_allfusion_erwin_dm">6.5  Synchronization Limitation With Visual Studio and AllFusion ERwin DM</a></h3>
<p>When you add an AllFusion ERwin DM model to a Visual Studio
project, a connection is established between AllFusion
ERwin DM and Visual Studio. When you save and close your
AllFusion ERwin DM model, your changes are made to the
Visual Studio schema.
<p>A known problem with the Microsoft Visual Studio API
results in certain user objects not being renamed or
deleted from the Visual Studio schema after being renamed
or deleted in the AllFusion ERwin DM model. This applies to
objects that are not owned by the schema, such as user,
database role, partition function, partition scheme, and
the schema itself. If you rename or delete these objects
from a model and save your changes, the objects are not
automatically renamed or deleted in the Visual Studio
project. You must manually delete the instances of these
object types from the Visual Studio Schema View. If you do
not manually modify the Visual Studio schema, the objects
are automatically repopulated into the AllFusion ERwin DM
model the next time you open it in Visual Studio.
<p>This issue will be resolved when an updated API is
available from Microsoft.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="features_added_to_improve_complete_compare_performance_with_allfusion_model_manager">6.6  Features Added to Improve Complete Compare Performance with AllFusion Model Manager</a></h3>
<p>New features have been added to maximize performance when
working with AllFusion Model Manager models and Complete
Compare. When two different users check out a model from
AllFusion Model Manager, change the model, and check it
back in to the mart, the differences display in the
Difference Reconciliation dialog (part of the Complete
Compare user interface).  
<p>A conflict exists when two users check the same model out
of the mart, and then change the same object or property.
When each user checks their models back in to the mart, a
"three-way merge" is necessary to reconcile the differences
made by each user, and the unchanged objects and properties
in the mart. The three-way merge of the models is sometimes
slow for large models because all objects participate in
the compare process.
<p>With r7.2.5 Service Pack 1, this compare functionality has
changed to reduce the scope of comparison to only objects
that have changed for both the local and mart version of
the models. The criteria for detecting changes include the
following:
<ul>
<p><li>Objects that have been created in either the local or the
mart copy.
<p><li>Objects that have been deleted or modified in at least one
of either the local or mart copy.
</ul>
<p>Two new options have been added to the Options dialog
available from the Tools menu. The Model Manager tab of the
Options dialog now includes the following check boxes:
<dl>
<p><dt><b>Bypass Difference Reconciliation Dialog if there are no
conflicts</b>
<dd>Select this check box to skip the Difference Reconciliation
dialog if no conflicts are detected between the version of
the model in the mart and the local version. If no
conflicts are detected, the local copy is updated from the
mart version before the model is saved.
<p><dt><b>Show All Objects in Difference Reconciliation Dialog</b>
<dd>Select this check box to turn off the options to optimize
the compare process. The Difference Reconciliation dialog
will display all objects including those that were not
modified in the checked out model and in the mart copy of
the model.

<h3><a name="release_numbers_on_documentation">9.1  Release Numbers on Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The release number on the title page of a document might
not correspond to the current product release number;
however, all documentation delivered with the product,
regardless of release number&nbsp;on the title page, will
support your use of the current product release. The
release number changes only when a significant portion of a
document changes to support a new or updated product
release. If no substantive changes are made to a document,
the release number does not change. For example, a document
for r7 may still be valid for r7.1 or even r7.2.
Documentation bookshelves always reflect the current
product release number.  
<p>Occasionally, we must update documentation outside of a new
or updated release. To indicate a minor change to the
documentation that does not invalidate it for any releases
that it supports, we update the edition number on the cover
page. First editions do not have an edition number.
